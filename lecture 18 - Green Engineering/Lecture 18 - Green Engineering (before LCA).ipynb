Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, halogens are the most common atoms in organic structures; bonding types include single, double and triple bonds; and functional groups are common reappearing arrangement of atoms that have predictable propertries. This way we can greatly reduce the number of meansurements by measuring the properties of a few dozens or hundreds of groups and use them for predicting the properties of any compounds. \n",

In a sample of gas in a container, the randomness of the molecular motion causes the number of collisions to fluctuate in a given time. However, because a huge number of molecules collide with the wall in a short time, the number of collisions on the scales of time and space we measure fluctuates by only a tiny, usually unobservable fraction from the average. \n",

    "One way of understanding this equation is thinking that we want to find a point (0 dimension) on the phase diagram, as this represents a single set of thermodynamic properties. If we have a single component system, the phase diagram is similar to the ones we have seen so far in this lecture. Specifying one intensive property reduces the dimension by 1. Adding a component adds another axis to the graph (to represent composition of the mixture), which adds one dimension. Each equilibrium provides an equation that relates composition of substances in the system, which allows us to secure a position on the composition axis.\n",

    ">For example, if we have a pure substance in the system and we know that the state is in the liquid region(2 dimension), specifying pressure ensures the point of the state we are looking for is on a horizontal line (1 dimension). If we then also specify the temperature, it ensures the point is on a vertical line. There is only one point that satisfies both requirements of the temperature and pressure.
